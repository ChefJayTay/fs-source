Perfect for cooking & maker streams, tutorials, product demos, or any stream where you want sources to appear when you look at the camera.

## ✨ What It Does

**You look at camera → Your chosen source appears across ALL scenes and canvases**<br>
**You look away → Source disappears (except in your monitoring scene)**

### 🎬 Real-World Example
You're cooking and have an overhead 180° camera watching you. When you look up to talk to chat, your face camera automatically appears. Look back down at your work, it disappears. No buttons, no switching scenes, completely automatic.

| 👀 Face Detected | 🙈 No Face |
|:---:|:---:|
| Face camera **visible** | Face camera **hidden** |
| Automatic switch | Automatic revert |

### 3️⃣ Configure

```bash
python setup.py  # Interactive setup wizard
```

### 4️⃣ Run

```bash
./run.sh           # Remote mode (NDI/network sources)
./run_daemon.sh    # Always-on daemon mode
./run_native.sh    # Native mode (local USB camera)
```

## 🔧 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Detection Camera<br/>180° overhead] --> B[AI Face Detection<br/>MediaPipe]
    B --> C{Face Detected?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Show Source<br/>ALL Scenes]
    C -->|No| E[Hide Source<br/>Except Detection Scene]
    D --> F[Auto Switch]
    E --> F
```

### Global Scene Control
Unlike traditional OBS automation that only works in one scene, FS Source controls source visibility **across all your scenes and canvases**, including Aitum vertical canvases. Switch scenes freely - the automation follows you.

> **Aitum requirement:** Multi-canvas discovery requires obs-websocket 5.7 or newer. On older versions, FS Source continues to control the main OBS canvas only.

## 🎮 Operating Modes

| Mode | Best For | Latency | Features |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| 🌐 **Remote** | NDI cameras, network streams | ~200ms | Multi-machine support, network monitoring |
| 🤖 **Daemon** | Production streams, 24/7 | ~100ms | Always-on, smart standby, auto-recovery |
| 🎥 **Native** | Local USB webcams | ~50ms | Direct camera access, lowest latency |


---

## 🧪 Testing Tools

```bash
# Test OBS connection and see all sources
python test_obs_connection.py

# Find local cameras (for native mode)
python test_local_camera.py

# Test face detection
python test_camera.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Example

```json
{
    "obs_host": "localhost",
    "obs_port": 4455,
    "obs_password": "your_password",
    
    "monitor_source_name": "180 Camera",
    "detection_scene_name": "Detection",
    "show_source_name": "Face Camera",
    
    "face_detection_confidence": 0.7,
    "check_interval": 0.5
}
```
